RPGMapper
=========

RPG Role Playing Mapper for playing old-school RPGs and map them to grid.

The source code is arranged as a CMake (see: http://www.cmake.org/) project.


1. Preparation
--------------

1.1 For compilation
-------------------

In order to compile the QKD sources we need at least the developer versions of:

    - gcc and g++ at least version 4.6.3
    - boost at least version 1.49
    - CMake
    - Qt4 at least version 4.4
    - Doxygen
    

Here are the steps which help you to setup a build system capable of compiling the sources on a pure Debian Wheezy system.

    # apt-get install build-essential g++ gcc libboost-all-dev cmake libqt4-dev doxygen 


If you want to use git to clone directly from GitHub:
    
    # apt-get install git
    
    (switch back to normal user)
    
    $ git clone http://TBD

    
    
1.2 For package install only
----------------------------

Despite a normal Debian Wheezy implementation you'll need:


    # apt-get install libboost-filesystem1.49.0 libboost-program-options1.49.0 libboost-system1.49.0 libqt4-core libqt4-gui 
    
These are the essential binary runtime packages listened in section "1.1" but for the non-developer version.

    

2. Compilation
--------------

Step into the "build" folder, invoke cmake and then make.

    $ mkdir build 2> /dev/null
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    

    
3. Installation
---------------

After a sucessfull build, step into the build folder and call make install (and ldconfig).

    $ cd build
    $ sudo make install
    $ sudo ldconfig
    

        
4. Packaging
------------

After a sucessfull build, you might as well create DEB packages for install on various Debian or Debain-based systems.

    $ cd build
    $ make package
    

        
5. License
----------
