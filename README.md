# RPGMapper

RPG Role Playing Mapper for playing old-school RPGs and map dungeons and areas on a grid. 
The goal of this project is to have a tiny, nice tool at hand, which lets the user create
any dungeon-like map. The user should be capable of sharing these maps freely.


## Preamble

In  this project of mine, I try to adhere to the recent software engineering principles found
in such books as:

* Robert C. Martin, "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"
* Stephan Roth, "Clean C++: Sustainable Software Development, and Best Practices 
with C++17"  

As for the latter, due to my target to support Debian, whose version number is - at the time
of writing - 9 and therefore ships with gcc-6.3, I'm locked at C++14. 

This is also a playground of mine to study, learn and experience new C++11, C++14 and C++17 
techniques.

Some more notes:
* The software is licensed under [GPL-3](http://gplv3.fsf.org).
* RPGMapper uses [Qt5](https://www.qt.io).
* [CMake](https://cmake.org)
* and [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)

## Edit 1

Aaaarrrgghhh! I cannot stand it to _not_ comment my work. After some months of inactivity 
I myself find it hard to reflect upon this code.

Therefore: sorry uncle Bob, I will comment my code.

## Edit 2

Obviously, it is hard to find and figure out the software patterns and C++ idioms I use.
I will include them in the documentation too.
